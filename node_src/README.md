## Declaration
To help developers’ evolvement at every stage 

## Vision
Technological innovation is the driving force behind the advancement of the blockchain industry, but many innovative projects have been misunderstood and ignored at their early stages. We have witnessed the growth process of great projects. Recalling that Ethereum and Polkadot were questioned as altcoins in the early days, they all went through difficult times. Therefore, Heco's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, Heco is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## Consensus (DPoS)
Revolutionizing Blockchain with DPoS: Lovely Network's Unparalleled Scalability and Validator System

- Lovely Network stands as a pioneering blockchain that implements the innovative Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. This mechanism ensures a remarkable transaction throughput of up to 100,000 TPS, minimal transaction latency, and cost-effectiveness. Through its unique DPoS implementation, Lovely Network not only enhances user experience but also presents an immensely promising solution for decentralized applications (Dapps).

- Becoming a validator on the Lovely network is no easy feat, as it entails undergoing a stringent qualification process. Any address has the opportunity to stake their assets to a qualifying address, setting the path towards becoming a validator. Once a validator accumulates sufficient staked volume to rank among the top 30,000, they gain recognition as an active validator in the succeeding epoch. This meticulous approach serves the primary objective of ensuring the utmost level of security and integrity across the network, while also offering abundant opportunities for interested parties to participate.

- The robustness of Lovely Network's validator capacity is truly remarkable, with a staggering capacity of 30,000 validators. This ensures ample room for validator participation, all while steadfastly upholding the network's integrity and security.
